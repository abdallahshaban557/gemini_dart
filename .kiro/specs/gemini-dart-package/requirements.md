# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for creating a comprehensive Dart package that provides multi-modal Gemini AI capabilities for both Dart and Flutter environments. The package will enable developers to interact with Google's Gemini AI models using text, images, and video inputs while receiving various output formats. The package should be easy to integrate, well-documented, and follow Dart/Flutter best practices.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Core Gemini AI Integration

**User Story:** As a Dart/Flutter developer, I want to integrate Gemini AI capabilities into my application, so that I can leverage advanced AI features without dealing with complex API implementations.

2. WHEN an API key is provided THEN the system SHALL authenticate successfully with Google's Gemini API
3. WHEN the package is initialized THEN the system SHALL validate the API key and connection
4. IF authentication fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages with troubleshooting guidance

### Requirement 2: Text Input and Output Support

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to send text prompts to Gemini and receive text responses, so that I can build conversational AI features in my application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a text prompt is sent THEN the system SHALL return a text response from Gemini
2. WHEN multiple conversation turns are needed THEN the system SHALL maintain conversation context
3. WHEN streaming responses are requested THEN the system SHALL provide real-time text streaming
4. IF the text input exceeds limits THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate error handling
5. WHEN custom parameters are specified THEN the system SHALL apply temperature, max tokens, and other generation settings

### Requirement 3: Image Input Support

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to send images along with text prompts to Gemini, so that I can build applications that analyze and understand visual content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an image file is provided THEN the system SHALL encode and send it to Gemini API
2. WHEN multiple image formats are used THEN the system SHALL support JPEG, PNG, WebP, and other common formats
3. WHEN images are combined with text THEN the system SHALL handle multi-modal prompts correctly
4. IF image size exceeds limits THEN the system SHALL provide automatic resizing or clear error messages
5. WHEN image analysis is requested THEN the system SHALL return detailed descriptions and insights

### Requirement 4: Video Input Support

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to send video files to Gemini for analysis, so that I can build applications that understand and process video content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a video file is provided THEN the system SHALL upload and process it with Gemini API
2. WHEN video analysis is requested THEN the system SHALL return frame-by-frame analysis or summary
3. WHEN video formats vary THEN the system SHALL support MP4, MOV, and other common video formats
4. IF video duration exceeds limits THEN the system SHALL provide chunking or appropriate error handling
5. WHEN video processing is in progress THEN the system SHALL provide status updates and progress indicators

### Requirement 5: Multi-Modal Output Handling

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to receive various types of outputs from Gemini, so that I can handle text, structured data, and other response formats appropriately.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN responses are received THEN the system SHALL parse and structure different output types
2. WHEN JSON responses are returned THEN the system SHALL provide proper deserialization
3. WHEN code generation is requested THEN the system SHALL format and highlight code responses
4. WHEN structured data is needed THEN the system SHALL support function calling and tool use
5. IF response parsing fails THEN the system SHALL provide fallback handling and error recovery

### Requirement 6: Flutter-Specific Features

**User Story:** As a Flutter developer, I want Flutter-optimized widgets and utilities, so that I can easily integrate Gemini AI into my mobile and web applications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN building Flutter UIs THEN the system SHALL provide pre-built widgets for common AI interactions
2. WHEN handling async operations THEN the system SHALL integrate with Flutter's FutureBuilder and StreamBuilder
3. WHEN managing state THEN the system SHALL work seamlessly with popular state management solutions
4. WHEN dealing with platform differences THEN the system SHALL handle iOS, Android, and web platform specifics
5. IF memory management is needed THEN the system SHALL optimize for mobile device constraints

### Requirement 7: Error Handling and Reliability

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive error handling and retry mechanisms, so that my application can gracefully handle API failures and network issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API calls fail THEN the system SHALL provide detailed error information and suggested actions
2. WHEN network issues occur THEN the system SHALL implement automatic retry with exponential backoff
3. WHEN rate limits are hit THEN the system SHALL queue requests and handle throttling appropriately
4. IF quota is exceeded THEN the system SHALL provide clear messaging about usage limits
5. WHEN timeouts occur THEN the system SHALL allow configurable timeout settings and graceful degradation

### Requirement 8: Configuration and Customization

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to configure the package behavior and customize AI model parameters, so that I can optimize performance for my specific use case.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN initializing the package THEN the system SHALL allow configuration of API endpoints, timeouts, and retry policies
2. WHEN making requests THEN the system SHALL support custom headers, user agents, and request metadata
3. WHEN using different models THEN the system SHALL allow model selection and parameter tuning
4. IF caching is needed THEN the system SHALL provide configurable response caching mechanisms
5. WHEN debugging is required THEN the system SHALL offer comprehensive logging and debugging options

### Requirement 9: Documentation and Examples

**User Story:** As a developer new to the package, I want comprehensive documentation and examples, so that I can quickly understand and implement Gemini AI features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing documentation THEN the system SHALL provide clear API documentation with examples
2. WHEN learning the package THEN the system SHALL include getting started guides and tutorials
3. WHEN implementing features THEN the system SHALL provide code examples for common use cases
4. IF troubleshooting is needed THEN the system SHALL include FAQ and common issues documentation
5. WHEN contributing THEN the system SHALL provide development setup and contribution guidelines

### Requirement 10: Performance and Optimization

**User Story:** As a developer building production applications, I want the package to be performant and efficient, so that my users have a smooth experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN handling large files THEN the system SHALL implement efficient upload and processing mechanisms
2. WHEN making multiple requests THEN the system SHALL support connection pooling and request batching
3. WHEN caching responses THEN the system SHALL implement intelligent caching strategies
4. IF memory usage is high THEN the system SHALL provide memory-efficient file handling and streaming
5. WHEN monitoring performance THEN the system SHALL provide metrics and performance insights
