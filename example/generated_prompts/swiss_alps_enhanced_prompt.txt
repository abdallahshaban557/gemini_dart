==================================

Original Request: "generate a picture of the swiss alps"

Enhanced Prompt:
## Prompt: Majestic Swiss Alps at Golden Hour

**Style:** Cinematic landscape photography, reminiscent of Ansel Adams, with a touch of painterly realism.

**Subject:** A breathtaking panorama of the Swiss Alps at golden hour.  The scene should feature prominent, snow-capped peaks, showcasing their majestic scale and texture.  Include a variety of peaks, with some shrouded in subtle, wispy clouds at their summits, suggesting a high-altitude alpine atmosphere.  The sky should be a vibrant gradient of warm oranges, yellows, and deep reds transitioning to a soft, cooler blue near the horizon.

**Foreground:** A tranquil alpine lake reflects the golden light and the surrounding mountains, adding a sense of depth and serenity.  The lake's shore features a lush, verdant alpine meadow with wildflowers in bloom.  A small, picturesque Swiss village is visible in the mid-ground, nestled amongst the lower slopes, hinting at human life within this majestic landscape.  The village should have traditional chalet-style architecture.

**Lighting:** Golden hour lighting – the sun should be low on the horizon, casting long shadows across the meadow and illuminating the peaks with a warm, golden glow.  The light should be diffused, not harsh, creating a soft, ethereal quality.

**Weather:** Clear skies with a few wispy cirrus clouds near the mountain peaks.  The air should appear crisp and clean.
